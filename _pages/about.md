My name is Zilong Liang (梁子龙). I am currently a Digital IC Design Engineer working for [Solomon Systech Limited](https://www.solomon-systech.com/), in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. I completed my MSc in Microelectronics Systems Design at the University of Southampton in United Kingdom, where I was supervised by [Dr. Mark Vousden](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xnt9q/doctor-mark-vousden). Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree of Engineering in Integrated Circuit Design from Heilongjiang University in China, under the guidance of [Dr. Jing Hu](https://dzgc.hlju.edu.cn/info/1068/2010.htm).
